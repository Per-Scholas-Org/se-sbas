**Skills-Based Assessment: Web Bookmark Manager with MERN Stack**

Objective: Create a full-stack MERN application that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) web bookmarks. The application should showcase your understanding of the MERN stack, ability to perform CRUD operations, manage state in React, and implement routing in Express.js.

Instructions:

1. **Project Setup:** Initialize a new MERN project. Set up a server with Node.js and Express, a database with MongoDB, and a client-side application with React.

2. **Database Schema:** Define a MongoDB schema for bookmarks. Each bookmark should have a title, a URL, and an optional description.

3. **CRUD API:** Use Express.js to create a REST API for performing CRUD operations on bookmarks. Your API should include routes for creating a new bookmark, retrieving all bookmarks, updating a bookmark, and deleting a bookmark.

4. **React Frontend:** Create a client-side application with React that interacts with your API. Users should be able to create, view, update, and delete bookmarks from the frontend.

5. **State Management:** Use React hooks to manage state in your application. Pay attention to when and how often your components re-render, and ensure that state updates are not causing unnecessary re-renders.

6. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to manage potential errors, including API errors (like a request failing) and user errors (like submitting a form with invalid data).

7. **Styling:** Style your application professionally. Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS library to style your components and layout. You could also consider using a component library like Material-UI or Ant Design.

Submission:

Please upload your code to a new repository on your GitHub account and include a README file with the following:

- Brief explanation of the application.
- Instructions on how to install and run your application.
- Any additional information you would like to share.

After you have uploaded your project to GitHub, please submit the URL of your repository via the assignment submission form.

Assessment:

Your application will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Functionality: Does the application meet the basic project requirements?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and free of syntax errors?
- User Experience: Is the application easy to navigate? Are errors handled gracefully?
- Best Practices: Does the code follow best practices for full stack MERN applications?

Please note: Be sure to comment your code to indicate which sections perform which functionality. This not only demonstrates your understanding but also makes it easier for others to read and understand your code.
