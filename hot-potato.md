**Skills-Based Assessment: Hot Potato - Collaborative Web Development with Git and GitHub**

Objective: Demonstrate your understanding of collaborative web development using Git and GitHub. Your team will create a simple HTML webpage, collaboratively add elements to it, manage pull requests and resolve merge conflicts. This exercise will be repeated for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Instructions:

1. **Team Formation:** Form a team of 3-5 learners. Elect one member to create a new GitHub repository. This repository should include a simple HTML file (`index.html`) with basic boilerplate code.

2. **HTML Phase:**
   - Each team member should fork the initial repository.
   - Each member should add a unique `div` or other HTML element to the `index.html` file on their forked repository.
   - Once the changes are made, each member should create a pull request back to the original repository.
   - As a team, review the pull requests and merge them into the original repository. If any merge conflicts arise, resolve them together.

3. **CSS Phase:**
   - Repeat the process for the CSS file (`styles.css`), with each member adding a unique style rule to the CSS file in their forked repository.
   - After the style rules have been added, create pull requests, review them as a team and merge them into the original repository, resolving any merge conflicts.

4. **JavaScript Phase:**
   - Repeat the process for the JavaScript file (`script.js`), with each member adding a unique functionality to the JavaScript file in their forked repository.
   - After the functionalities have been added, create pull requests, review them as a team and merge them into the original repository, resolving any merge conflicts.

5. **Reflection:**
   - As a team, document your experience in the `README.md` file of the original repository. Discuss the bugs and challenges you encountered, how you resolved them, and any other interesting observations from the exercise.

Submission:

Please submit the URL of the original GitHub repository via the assignment submission form. The repository should include the final versions of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as the `README.md` file with your team's reflection.

Assessment:

Your team's submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Collaborative Work: Did all team members contribute to the project?
- Git and GitHub Usage: Did the team correctly use fork, pull request, and merge functionalities on GitHub?
- Code Quality: Are the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files well-structured, readable, and free of syntax errors?
- Reflection: Does the `README.md` file effectively document the team's experience, bugs, challenges and their resolutions?

Remember to comment your code where necessary. This demonstrates your understanding and makes it easier for others to comprehend your code.
