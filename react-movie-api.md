**Skills-Based Assessment: Movie Search Application with React & OMDB API**

Objective: Create a React application that allows users to search for movies using the OMDB API. The application should showcase your understanding of React principles, ability to work with APIs, and skills in creating and managing stateful components.

Instructions:

1. **Project Setup:** Initialize a new React project using `Create React App` or any other boilerplate that you are comfortable with.

2. **OMDB API Integration:** Register for an API key from the OMDB API. Make sure to use a `.env` file to securely store the key, and never push the `.env` file to Github.

3. **Search Component:** Create a search component that includes a form where users can enter the title of a movie. When the form is submitted, your application should make a request to the OMDB API with the movie title the user entered.

4. **Display Results:** Display the search results from the OMDB API in your application. At minimum, the results should include the movie's title, year of release, and a brief synopsis.

5. **Error Handling:** Your application should handle potential errors gracefully. This includes API errors, such as a request failing, or user errors, such as submitting a blank search form.

6. **State Management:** Use React hooks to manage state in your application. Pay attention to when and how often your components re-render, and ensure that state updates are not causing unnecessary re-renders.

7. **Styling:** Although functionality is more important than appearance for this assessment, aim to present your application professionally. Utilize CSS or a CSS-in-JS library to style your components and layout. Feel free to use a component library like Material-UI or Ant Design.

Submission:

Please upload your code to a new repository on your GitHub account and include a README file with the following:

- Brief explanation of the application.
- Instructions on how to install and run your application.
- Any additional information you would like to share.

After you have uploaded your project to GitHub, please submit the URL of your repository via the assignment submission form.

Assessment:

Your application will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Functionality: Does the application meet the basic project requirements?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and free of syntax errors?
- User Experience: Is the application easy to navigate? Are errors handled gracefully?
- Best Practices: Does the code follow React best practices?

Please note: Be sure to comment your code to indicate which sections perform which functionality. This not only demonstrates your understanding but also makes it easier for others to read and understand your code.
